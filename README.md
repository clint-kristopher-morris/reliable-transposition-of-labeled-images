# reliable-transposition-of-labeled-images
I have been developing and exploring methods to reduce the effort of collecting labeling images for training deep learning models. See my prior work with developing:

* [Deep-Learning Assisted Images Scraper ]( https://github.com/clint-kristopher-morris/yolo-assisted-image-scrape)
* Implementing SCAN (Learning to Classify Images without Labels)
